For Mrs. Taricco

The player movement is currently controled with the arrow keys on the keyboard. The heart buttons 
lead to each respective scene with either the to-do list, the schedule, or the habit tracker.

The to-do list is functional, but items do not "snap" into columns
The schedule is functional, but items do not "snap" into time segments and tasks are not carried over
from the to-do list
The habit tracker is a work in progress. There are a few bugs with instancing the sliders.

The concept code for the second to-do list format is included if you would like to view it. The scene can be run separately and 
is called "ConceptToDo.tscn"
